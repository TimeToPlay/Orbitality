# Orbitality
Full playable game.
For this test task, You are required to create a game (let’s call it “Orbitality”). This is
planetary artillery arcade in pseudo 2D (i.e. 2D game in 3D world).
Player is in control of a planet, rotating around Sun. Planet can shoot rockets from it’s
forward point, rockets obey gravity (of Sun and of other planets) meaning they fly in
parabolic trajectories. On collision with Sun, rocket disappears, on collision with planet -
does damage.
You need to create singleplayer game mode with AI players (random number from
configurable min/max values).
Rest of features:
● Planets should be visually different (and random)
● Implement 3 types of rockets with different base stats (acceleration, weight, cooldown
etc), which are distributed randomly amongst planets
● Pause/resume feature
● Save/load feature
● UI: main menu, HUD, planet HUD (HP bar, shooting cooldown)
